# PSU_42sh_2018
42sh Epitech final year project, we had to write a program in C capable of emulating a UNIX-type command interpreter. The 42Sh can be likened to "Bash" or "Tcsh".

# Getting started
# Prerequisites
Unix System with all Standard C Lib

# Install the project
First you need to clone the repository: Do not forget to upload your SSH Key into github and having the right access.

git@github.com:adamhamza99/PSU_42sh_2018.git

# After you need run it:

make

or

make re

# Run it
When everything is installed, if you want to run it, do the following:

./42sh

# Compile rules
# Makefile rules

make ---> compile lib and all source , create 42sh executable.
make clean --> delete object files.
make fclean --> same as make clean but delete the executable too.
make re --> do a make fclean and recompile all.
